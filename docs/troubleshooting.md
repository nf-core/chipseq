# nf-core/chipseq: Troubleshooting

## Extra resources and getting help
If you still have an issue with running the pipeline then feel free to contact us.
Have a look at the [pipeline website](https://github.com/nf-core/chipseq) to find out how.

If you have problems that are related to Nextflow and not our pipeline then check out the [Nextflow gitter channel](https://gitter.im/nextflow-io/nextflow) or the [google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nextflow).
