## Introduction

**nfcore/chipseq** is a bioinformatics analysis pipeline used for Chromatin ImmunopreciPitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data.

On release, automated continuous integration tests run the pipeline on a [full-sized dataset](https://github.com/nf-core/test-datasets/tree/chipseq#full-test-dataset-origin) on the AWS cloud infrastructure. The dataset consists of FoxA1 (transcription factor) and EZH2 (histone,mark) IP experiments from _Franco et al. 2015_ ([GEO: GSE59530](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE59530), [PMID: 25752574](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25752574/)) and _Popovic et al. 2014_ ([GEO: GSE57632](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE57632), [PMID: 25188243](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25188243/)), respectively. This ensures that the pipeline runs on AWS, has sensible resource allocation defaults set to run on real-world datasets, and permits the persistent storage of results to benchmark between pipeline releases and other analysis sources. The results obtained from running the full-sized tests can be viewed on the [nf-core website](https://nf-co.re/chipseq/results).

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It uses Docker/Singularity containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible. The [Nextflow DSL2](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/dsl2.html) implementation of this pipeline uses one container per process which makes it much easier to maintain and update software dependencies. Where possible, these processes have been submitted to and installed from [nf-core/modules](https://github.com/nf-core/modules) in order to make them available to all nf-core pipelines, and to everyone within the Nextflow community!

## Online videos

A short talk about the history, current status and functionality on offer in this pipeline was given by Jose Espinosa-Carrasco ([@joseespinosa](https://github.com/joseespinosa)) on [26th July 2022](https://nf-co.re/events/2022/bytesize-chipseq) as part of the nf-core/bytesize series.

You can find numerous talks on the [nf-core events page](https://nf-co.re/events) from various topics including writing pipelines/modules in Nextflow DSL2, using nf-core tooling, running nf-core pipelines as well as more generic content like contributing to Github. Please check them out!

## Usage

:::note
If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how
to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline)
with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.
:::

To run on your data, prepare a tab-separated samplesheet with your input data. Please follow the [documentation on samplesheets](https://nf-co.re/chipseq/usage#samplesheet-input) for more details. An example samplesheet for running the pipeline looks as follows:

```csv
sample,fastq_1,fastq_2,antibody,control
WT_BCATENIN_IP_REP1,BLA203A1_S27_L006_R1_001.fastq.gz,,BCATENIN,WT_INPUT_REP1
WT_BCATENIN_IP_REP2,BLA203A25_S16_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz,,BCATENIN,WT_INPUT_REP2
WT_BCATENIN_IP_REP2,BLA203A25_S16_L002_R1_001.fastq.gz,,BCATENIN,WT_INPUT_REP2
WT_BCATENIN_IP_REP2,BLA203A25_S16_L003_R1_001.fastq.gz,,BCATENIN,WT_INPUT_REP2
WT_BCATENIN_IP_REP3,BLA203A49_S40_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz,,BCATENIN,WT_INPUT_REP3
WT_INPUT_REP1,BLA203A6_S32_L006_R1_001.fastq.gz,,,
WT_INPUT_REP2,BLA203A30_S21_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz,,,
WT_INPUT_REP2,BLA203A30_S21_L002_R1_001.fastq.gz,,,
WT_INPUT_REP3,BLA203A31_S21_L003_R1_001.fastq.gz,,,
```

Now, you can run the pipeline using:

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/chipseq --input samplesheet.csv --outdir <OUTDIR> --genome GRCh37 -profile <docker/singularity/podman/shifter/charliecloud/conda/institute>
```

See [usage docs](https://nf-co.re/chipseq/usage) for all of the available options when running the pipeline.

:::warning
Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those
provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_;
see [docs](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration#custom-configuration-files).
:::

For more details and further functionality, please refer to the [usage documentation](https://nf-co.re/chipseq/usage) and the [parameter documentation](https://nf-co.re/chipseq/parameters).
